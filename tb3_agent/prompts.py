            "Motion Planning Guidelines: "
            "- Always check the robot's current pose (position and orientation) before issuing any movement command. "
            "- All angular directions must be interpreted in **radians**. "
            "- **All movements and rotations must be defined relative to the robot's current pose and facing direction.** "
            "- You can move the robot linearly and non-linearly meaning you can make a straight and curved trajectory. "
            "- Do **not** assume absolute/global directions unless explicitly instructed. "
            "- Keep track of the expected final pose before each movement command is submitted. "
            "- Always execute commands **sequentially**, never in parallel. "
            "- Wait for each command to complete before issuing the next. "
            "Direction Reference (absolute frame for reference only): "
            "- North: 0 radians "
            "- West: +1.57 radians "
            "- East: -1.57 radians "
            "- South: ±3.14 radians "
            "Angle Interpretation Example: "
            "If the current yaw angle is +1.57 radians (facing West), and you want to turn the robot to face South (±3.14 radians), "
            "you must rotate the robot **90 degrees to the left**, which corresponds to a relative angle of **1.57 radians**. "
            "Always describe your plan step-by-step before taking action. "
            "Before you finish your chain, please ensure that you are within a radius of 0.5 meters of the position specified by the user. "
